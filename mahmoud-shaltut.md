Sheikh Mahmoud Shaltut: A Visionary of Islamic Reform


He Born on April 23, 1893, in the Beheira Governorate of Lower Egypt, Sheikh Mahmoud Shaltut began his journey in Islamic scholarship by leaving his small village of Binyat Bani Mansur at the age of thirteen. He enrolled in the newly established Azhar-affiliated Ma’had dini in Alexandria. Completing his studies in 1918, he earned his Alimiyya Degree (Azhar’s equivalent to a BA) and began teaching at the same institute the following year. In 1927, Shaltut was called to lecture at the Higher Division of Al-Azhar, marking the beginning of a lifelong association with the prestigious institution.


Shaltut’s career at Al-Azhar was deeply influenced by Sheikh Mohammad Moustafa al-Maraghi, who became rector of the university in 1929. Al-Maraghi’s reformist agenda resonated with Shaltut’s own ideas for modernizing Al-Azhar and separating its religious functions from state control. Despite his alignment with reformist ideals, Shaltut faced resistance from conservative factions. Following the removal of al-Maraghi, Shaltut was dismissed from Al-Azhar in 1931. During his time away, he practiced law in the Shari’a courts. When al-Maraghi was reappointed in 1935, Shaltut returned to Al-Azhar and steadily rose through its ranks. By 1957, he was appointed Vice-Rector, and the following year, President Gamal Abdel Nasser named him Sheikh al-Azhar.


Assuming his position in 1958, Shaltut introduced sweeping reforms at Al-Azhar. His vision emphasized integrating Islamic teachings into modern society, proving that Shari’a law could serve as a guide for navigating contemporary challenges. He was instrumental in passing the 1961 Reform Law, which expanded Al-Azhar’s curriculum to include broader disciplines, aiming to produce scholars capable of addressing the needs of modern Muslims. Shaltut sought greater independence for Al-Azhar from state control but worked to align the institution with Egypt’s modernization efforts under Nasser’s regime.

Shaltut’s regular religious broadcasts, later published as Ahadith al-Sabah fi’l-Midhya and Yas’aluna (“Ask Us”), expanded his reach and influence, showcasing his ability to connect with a wide audience. He addressed contemporary societal issues such as family law, birth control, and polygamy, presenting Shari’a as practical guidance for everyday life.


Sheikh Shaltut is celebrated for his efforts to promote harmony between Sunni and Shi’a Muslims, fostering open dialogue and issuing a groundbreaking fatwa recognizing the validity of Twelver Shi’a practices. He championed Islam as a religion of unity, moderation, and reason, vehemently opposing sectarianism and advocating for tolerance.

Despite his achievements, Shaltut’s modernist interpretations and alignment with state reform efforts were met with criticism. Many viewed him as a figure placed to serve the regime rather than the religion, creating a divide between his vision and traditional Islamic scholars. Nevertheless, his work left a lasting impact on Islamic thought and Al-Azhar’s role in modern society.
